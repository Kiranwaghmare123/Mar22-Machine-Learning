Learning:
  -the acquisition of knowledge or skills through experience, study or by being taught.


Machine Learning:(T,E,P)
  -A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of Task T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks T as measured by P, improves with experience E.
