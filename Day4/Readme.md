Steps for implementing ML Model

    1.Importing the dataset

    2.Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set

    3.Scaling

    4.Fitting Simple Linear Regression to the Training set

    5.Predicting the Test set results

    6.Visualizing the Test set results




Interview Questions:
--------------------

    1. What are the different types of regression.
    
    2. Is regression a supervised learning? Why?
    
    3. Explain the ordinary least squares method for regression.
    
    4. What are linear, multinomial and polynomial regressions.
    
    5. If model used for regression is
    y = a + b(x âˆ’ 1)2;
        is it a multinomial regression? If not, what type of regression is it?
        
    6. What does the line of regression tell you?
